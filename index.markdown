<h1> Data 198: Introduction to Real World Data Science <h2>

<p>
Welcome to Data Science Society at Berkeley’s very own DeCal: Introduction to Real World Data Science, a semester-long course geared towards introducing students to essential data science skills through project-based learning. Our program takes a departure from the traditional classroom setting by allowing members to work collaboratively on an original data science project of their choosing. Members will have full creative control and will receive mentorship from our Decal’s committee members. We will cover every step of the data science lifecycle: from formulating a data-centric project idea, to extracting stories with exploratory data analysis, to finally creating and evaluating machine learning models.
</p>

<br>

<p>
This introductory course covers a wide variety of data science concepts both traditionally and not traditionally taught in the lecture halls of Berkeley. We aim to give students programming expertise by providing engaging lessons going through the data science lifecycle while they work through the project lifecycle themselves in a semester-long project.
</p>

<br>

<p>
In this course, not only will students develop and hone their technical expertise, they will also experience data science in the real world through panels and speaker events. All this and more will challenge students and elevate them in the search for post-graduate opportunities, while still maintaining the low-pressure environment of a DeCal that values learning above all else.
</p>

<h2 id="materials">Materials</h2>

<p>All materials for the course, including the textbook and assignments, are
available for free online under a Creative Commons license.</p>

<p><strong>Textbook</strong>: <a href="http://inferentialthinking.com">Computational and Inferential Thinking: The Foundations of Data
Science</a> is a free online textbook that
includes interactive Jupyter notebooks and public data sets for all examples.
The textbook source is maintained as an <a href="https://github.com/data-8/textbook">open source
project</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Assignments</strong>:
All assignments from Fall 2015 to current iterations of the course are available in this repository
as Jupyter notebooks. The notebooks assume a Python 3 installation
with the standard modules from <a href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads">an Anaconda
installation</a> such as Numpy and Matplotlib,
as well as the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/datascience/">datascience</a> and, depending on the year,
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/okpy/">okpy</a> or <a href="https://otter-grader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">otter-grader</a> modules.</p>

<p><strong>Lecture Materials</strong>: All lecture videos, slides and demonstration notebooks from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFeJ2hV8Fyt7mjvwrDQ2QNYEYdtKSNA0y">Fall
2016</a> to current iterations of the course are available via links on the respective course calendars.

To request access to the source of the slides for
instructional purposes, please fill out our <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfw6iN-V58Urvg7RRfbjNQceisLULBizg0qku1_2qV8cvOtvA/viewform">Data 8 Instructor

form.</p>

<h2 id="infrastructure">Infrastructure</h2>

<p>All of the software components of the course are maintained as open-source
projects. We encourage you to contact us if you want any help using them.
We also have prepared <a href="http://data8.org/zero-to-data-8/">a guide on how to set up course
infrastructure</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The <a href="http://data8.org/datascience"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">datascience</code></a> module</strong>: The course uses a module
for table manipulation, charts, and maps that provides an interface appropriate
for an introductory course. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Table</code> class is similar to a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DataFrame</code> in
<a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a>, but explicitly does not support row
indexes, hierarchical indexes, time series data, missing values, slicing, and
many other advanced features that can complicate table manipulation for novices.
The charting features use Matplotlib, but customize the output to match the
pedagogical goals of the course. The mapping features are implemented by
<a href="https://github.com/python-visualization/folium">Folium</a>, but aim to simplify
working with tables and geojson files. While the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">datascience</code> module can
certainly be used outside the context of the course, it was specifically
designed to support the Data 8 curriculum, while setting up students to
transition to more standard tools such as Pandas.</p>

<p><strong>The <a href="https://otter-grader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">otter-grader</a> automatic grading software</strong>: All notebooks are created using the otter-grader notebook creation format. This software generates two notebooks from a parent notebook. The first contains only “public” tests that are used to help students evaluate whether or not solutions to questions are correct – a type of client-side validation for the student. The second notebook contains solutions as well as “private” tests that students are not able to see. These tests are usually used to evaluate correctness and edge cases as well as assign points.  This system is used in conjuction with <a href="http://gradescope.com">GradeScope</a> at Berkeley to grade and assign points to student work but an instructor is also able grade notebooks on their own machines, see the documentation at <a href="https://otter-grader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">otter-grader</a>, as well as use a free service that we deployed called <a href="http://grader.datahub.berkeley.edu/">otter-service-standalone</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Hosted Computing Environment</strong>:
We provide a hosted environment for our students to edit and execute their
Notebooks. It includes two components, a <a href="https://github.com/data-8/jupyterhub-k8s/blob/master/README.md">Kubernetes-based deployment of
JupyterHub</a> that
we have specifically designed for courses, and an <a href="https://github.com/data-8/nbinteract">assignment
server</a> that loads assignments into the
students’ environment.</p>

<p>If you want more information about any of these tools, please fill out our <a href="https://forms.gle/maRqsceCvTNnqQ3w9">Data 8 Instructor Interest</a> form or email <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ds-help@berkeley.edu</code>.</p>
